# AnathemTransformer
A novel and experimental transformer architecture 

The multi-silo architecture is inspired by the Science Cloisters in Neal Stephenson's sci-fi book "Anathem" -- multiple scales and multiple silos, with the ultimate goal of fast performance without compromising capacity.

This repository is correctly in the early stage development, and is mostly just a jupyter notebook.
